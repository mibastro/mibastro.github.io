### Description
3D Data (both 3D scans captured by depth sensors and 3D models created by designers) are widely used in many applications in computer vision, computer graphics, and robotic, such as autonomous driving, AI-assisted 3D object/scene design, augmented reality, and physical robot interaction. Along with the recent increasing demands on processing and analyzing such 3D data, there has been tremendous progress in developing novel technologies, especially based on deep learning. In this course, we will cover the recent advances in machine learning techniques for 3D data and also discuss the remaining challenges. Most of the course material will be less-than-5-year-old research papers in CVPR/ICCV/ECCV (Vision), SIGGRAPH/SIGGRAPH Asia (Graphics), and NeurIPS/ICML (Machine Learning). The course will be project-oriented (no exam, no paper-and-pencil homework, but easy programming assignment), and it will combine pedagogical lectures and seminar-style reading group presentations (followed by interactive discussions). Lectures will be held online via zoom.
<br />


### Lectures
Tue/Thu 9:00am - 10:15am in Zoom
